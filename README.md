# Crop-predication-model
📌 Project Overview:
Agriculture is a vital part of many economies, and helping farmers choose the right crop based on local conditions (like soil, weather, etc.) can significantly increase productivity. This project uses machine learning to build a Crop Prediction System that suggests the most suitable crop to grow based on user-inputted environmental features.

The model is integrated into an interactive Streamlit web interface, allowing users (farmers, students, researchers) to easily input parameters and instantly get crop recommendations.

🎯 Objective:
To build a machine learning model that predicts the best crop to cultivate based on:

🧪 Soil nutrients (N, P, K)

🌡️ Temperature

💧 Humidity

☀️ pH level

🌧️ Rainfall

🔧 Technologies Used:
Component	Tool / Framework
Programming Language	Python
ML Library	scikit-learn
Model Used	Random Forest / SVM / KNN
Web UI	Streamlit
Dataset	Crop Recommendation Dataset (Kaggle or custom)
